C2-Chopper framework's plugins repository. You can fork this repository and starting creating your plugins right off the bat, it's quite simple. 

You can view the `RequireAgent` plugin as an example, till we make a CLI tool to make the process quicker and easier. 
If you have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue ðŸ˜„


### Dev notes
You must open the plugin folder instead of the repository's to avoid import errors.
